    <h1>A Recipe for Carbonara Pasta</h1>
    <img src="../images/carbonara.jpg" alt="An image of spaghetti carbonara on a plate.">

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Spaghetti Carbonara is a classic Italian recipe consisting of cubed pork product (usually guanciale), spaghetti, and a sauce made from egg yolks and parmesan/parmigiano reggiano cheese.</p>
    <p>Like many Italian recipes it is simplistic, relying more on the quality of its ingredients and application of technique to achieve excellence. </p>
    <p>Done right, it leads to an creamy sauce with rich pork and cheese flavor that coats your palette and leaves you wanting for the next bite.</p>
    <p>The recipe I have here today is adapted to have ingredients that you can find at your local grocery store.</p>
    <p>It also has the addition of garlic, which I think makes the dish even tastier.</p>
    <p>Note that I do not claim that this is an authentic recipe, only that it tastes great to me.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>Makes two servings.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>600 grams of spaghetti</li>
        <li>6 cups of water</li>
        <li>5 slices of bacon</li>
        <li>2 cups of grated Parmesan or Parmigiano Regiano cheese</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Two whole eggs and two egg yolks</li>
        <li>Three garlic cloves, grated</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start bringing your water to a boil in a shallow pan, add salt to season the pasta, and cook your spaghetti according to the package instructions. </li>
        <li>Prep your other ingredients.</li>
        <li>Cut each slice of bacon vertically into smaller strips. </li>
        <li>Combine your eggs and yolks in a small bowl with your grated cheese, and stir to combine. </li>
        <li>Place your bacon into a separate pan over medium-low heat, stirring often until all of the pork fat has rendered out.</li>
        <li>Once the pasta is 2 minutes away from being done, strain the pasta, reserving 1/2 a cup of pasta water. </li>
        <li>Once the bacon has been rendered and the bacon is crispy, add the pasta directly to the bacon pan and stir/toss vigorously until an emulsion forms (should take 1-2 minutes)  </li>
        <li>Let the pan cool down for 1-2 minutes and add the egg-cheese mixture to the pan. <strong>Immediately</strong> start stirring and tossing until your sauce comes together. Do not stop stirring until your sauce looks smooth, and make sure you stir evenly. If you do not stir well the eggs will curdle and the sauce will not be smooth. </li>
        <li>Serve the pasta while it is still warm. </li>
    </ol>
