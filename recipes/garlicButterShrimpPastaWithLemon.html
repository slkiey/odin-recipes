    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lemon garlic shrimp pasta has been a favorite of mine due to its simplicity, elegance, and overall tastiness.</p>
    <p>It's a dish that can come together in 15-20 minutes, leaving you full but not bogged down.</p>
    <p>The acidity helps to cut into the richness of the butter, the garlic helps to add a depth of flavor, and the lemon zest brightens up the entire dish.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>300g spaghetti or preferred pasta</li>
        <li>Two tablespoons of butter</li>
        <li>Two teaspoons of red chili flakes</li>
        <li>Five garlic cloves</li>
        <li>500g of frozen shrimp</li>
        <li>Five cups of water</li>
        <li>Two teaspoons dried parsley</li>
        <li>One whole lemon</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring the water to a boil in a shallow pan and add your pasta. Cook according to the package instructions. Add salt to season the pasta.</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, prepare your other ingredients.</li>
        <li>Remove the peel from your garlic cloves if needed and finely mince them. You can also use a garlic press. </li>
        <li>Use a zester or microplane to remove the lemon zest from the lemon and set aside. </li>
        <li>Squeeze the juice of the lemon into a bowl.</li>
        <li>Assess the doneness of the pasta. If it is done, drain some of the water away, keeping a half cup of pasta water for later. If it is not, move on to the next step.</li>
        <li>Add the butter to a frying pan and wait until it starts to sizzle.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic cloves and chili flakes and allow them to fry for 30 seconds. </li>
        <li>Add the frozen shrimp and cook until both sides of the shrimp are pink. Should only take a minute. Add salt to taste at this point.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked pasta to the pan and vigorously stir to form a nice, smooth sauce. </li>
        <li>Remove the pan from heat and add the juice of the lemon, the lemon zest, and the parsley. </li>
        <li>Give the pan one last good stir and serve while still hot. </li>
    </ol>
